     ```bash  
     git clone https://github.com/ardiz99/TBAse.git  
     ```

   ```  
   If you don’t have Docker installed, you can download it from here https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/

4. Once the containers are running, open another terminal (ensure it’s the Command Prompt, as PowerShell may not work) and execute the following command to initialize the database:
   ```bash  
   docker exec -i db mysql -uroot -proot_password < ./db/ase.sql 
   ```
   
5. Test the APIs you need. All available APIs are documented in the TBAse/doc folder as OpenAPI files. You can import these into Swagger to explore them:
   - Open Swagger Editor.
   - Go to File > Import File.
   - Select the .yaml file corresponding to the API you want to test.

6. If you want you can import a set of APIs used for testing.
   - Open Postman. (You can download it here https://www.postman.com/downloads/
   - Click on Import > select files
   - Navigate to TBAse/doc and select TBASE.postman_collection.json file.
